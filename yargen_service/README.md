# yarGen Service for CRITs

This CRITs service is based off of Florian Roth's yarGen script. 
(https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen)

The purpose of this service is to make it possible to generate simple 
and "super" yara rules based on the samples related to a given TLO.

As it stands, this service is very much in an "alpha" stage, needing a 
lot of additions to allow for customization, and needing a ton of code 
clean-up. However, I'm currently working on a different project, and 
figured I would upload this as-is for anyone to clone/fork until I have 
a chance to come back to it.

Please note, after clicking the 'Run YarGen' button, depending on how
many samples were submitted, it could take several minutes to generate
the yarGen rules.
